## Base16 themes for LightTable

These are a selection of themes using Chris Kempson's [Base16 color schemes](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16). They are not the same as the CodeMirror themes for Base16 created with [Base16 Builder](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-builder). They are instead based off the Sublime Text Base16 themes.

Check out the [Base16 preview page](http://chriskempson.github.io/base16/) to get an idea for what these look like.
